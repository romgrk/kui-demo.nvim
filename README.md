# kui-demo.nvim

This demo repository contains a minimal kui.nvim template.

This package has a dependency on [kui.nvim](https://github.com/romgrk/kui.nvim) at runtime, which itself depends on
the user having a terminal with support for the [kitty graphics protocol](https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/graphics-protocol/)
as well as [libcairo](https://www.cairographics.org/) installed.

At compile time, this package has some dependencies that can be satisfied with `pnpm install` (see [pnpm.io](https://pnpm.io/)).
